## Welcome to WorldAnvil Scratchpad

This is not the place to report bugs! Report them in the [Bug-Tracker](https://github.com/worldanvil/worldanvil-bug-tracker) for World Anvil.

To make a specific feature suggestion or request do so on the [Community Features Voting](https://www.worldanvil.com/community/voting/) Board.

This space is for the community to share, discuss and refine ideas for expansions and feature improvements. It is also used to collect and document known issues and potential workarounds. 

The repository itself is maintained by volunteers and not the World Anvil Team itself. The maintainers reserve the right to moderate any discussions and remove unconstructive criticism as necessary.
